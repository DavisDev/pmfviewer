Don't let the above scare you, this program cannot brick you psp as it is a user mode application

Pmf Viewer allows you to browse the drives available on you psp(that I knew of) and view 
pmf video files.

You can also browse images(iso and cso) and view the videos they contain.
This is based on the m33 sdk so may only work on m33 cfw
